##  Introduction
We introduce a pipeline for 3D model part functionality analysis. Given a textured shape as input, our pipeline first encodes its shape geometry and texture image to functionality latent codes. Then the latent codes index interacting objects that represent part functions. 
For more details, please refer to our pre-print paper https://github.com/Cuijh50892/SMI2023GRSI/blob/main/8.Pre-print/pre-print.pdf

## Replicating Results and Interactive Applications
We develop an interactive application to show the analysis result and our representative figure is generated by capturing the application interface. So it needs user interactions to replicate the materials. The manipulation is simple and intuitive. First, please run ‘FunctionalityVisualizer.exe’ in the ‘Software’ folder. Second, click the ‘Load Model’ button and pick an obj file in ‘1.TestParts’, for example, ‘1.TestParts/1/1_part_1.obj’. Please pick the first obj file in a folder and the other files will be loaded together automatically. Finally, the part functionality analysis result can be shown by clicking ‘Function1/2/3’ button with different indication colors. We provide a video to demonstrate this procedure and we thank you for your suggestions and comments.       

Unity3D 2021.3.4 (https://unity.cn/releases/lts/2021) is required to compile the code and build the software.
